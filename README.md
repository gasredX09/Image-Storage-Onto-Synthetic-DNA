# Image-Storage-Onto-Synthetic-DNA
This repository contains the code, results, and presentation for implementing DNA-based image storage. It explores encoding digital images into DNA sequences using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for compression and adhering to biological constraints such as GC balance and pattern avoidance.

## Contents
- **Code**: Python scripts for encoding images into DNA sequences and decoding them back.
- **Outputs**: Encoded DNA sequences in FASTA format and reconstructed images.
- **Presentation**: Slides explaining the methodology, challenges, and results of the project.

## Highlights
- Implements an optimized encoding workflow for high-density, error-resilient DNA data storage.
- Demonstrates successful encoding and decoding of a 1000x1000 pixel image.
- Discusses practical implications and future directions for scalable DNA-based data storage solutions.
